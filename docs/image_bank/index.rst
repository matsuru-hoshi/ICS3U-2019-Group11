===========

Before we can start coding, we need to have the artwork and other assets. These are merely for prettiness. 

I've chosen some preset colours and font so I can always go back to it. This font is shoould be available by default on Windows and Mac

Main Colour: #7d3f3b
Font: Times Bold
Secondary Colour: #400707


I'll be using these pictures of chocolate I found online and a poorly drawn set of logos.
